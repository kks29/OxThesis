\subsection*{Personal}

%This is where you thank your advisor, colleagues, and family and friends.%


\subsection*{Institutional}

%If you want to separate out your thanks for funding and institutional support, I don't think there's any rule against it.  Of course, you could also just remove the subsections and do one big traditional acknowledgement section.%
